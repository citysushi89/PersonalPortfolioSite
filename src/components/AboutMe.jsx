            <p>Hey! My name is Owen. 
            I am a North Carolina-based programmer with a passion for solving problems and working with data! On this site, 
            the smaller projects page contains mostly text-based projects designed to accomplish a task 
            or build a particular tool. The larger projects page contains a combination of projects designed for deployment and groups of 
            of smaller projects that share a similar theme or purpose. 
            Please use the Contact Me tab on the header if you'd like to reach out!</p>
